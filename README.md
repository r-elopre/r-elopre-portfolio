## Summary  
**Versatile and results-oriented professional** with strong exposure to **Full-Stack Development** and **AI Engineering**.
All my projects are **meticulously documented** to cater to different types of viewers:

- **For those who want in-depth technical details** — each repository contains a comprehensive **README** outlining architecture, methodology, and implementation steps.

- **For those who prefer a high-level, visually engaging overview** — I’ve prepared **professional PowerPoint presentations**, featured at the top of each README, summarizing the project’s purpose, workflow, and results in a concise, compelling format.

Whether you’re here for the **deep technical dive** or a **quick, insightful snapshot**, my project documentation is designed to deliver both clarity and impact.

[AI Engineering Roadmap](https://github.com/r-elopre/AI-Engineer-Roadmap)

<br><br>

### Data Scientist  
- Designed and implemented comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines for the transforming raw data into machine-learning-ready formats.  
  - <span style="color:green">**Titanic Data Cleaning Pipeline**</span>:    
    - **Output**: `train_scaled.csv` with encoded categorical variables and standardized numeric features, ready for modeling.  
    - **GitHub**: [Titanic Data Cleaning](https://github.com/r-elopre/titanic-data-cleaning) 
    &nbsp;  
  - **Healthcare Data Cleaning Pipeline**:   
    - **Output**: `healthcare_scaled.csv`, fully numeric and scaled for modeling.  
    - **GitHub**: [Healthcare Data Cleaning](https://github.com/r-elopre/healthcare-data-cleaning) 

<br><br>

### Machine Learning Engineer   
- Developed and evaluated a **Titanic Logistic Regression Model** to predict passenger survival using the preprocessed `train_scaled.
  - **GitHub**: [Titanic Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/r-elopre/Titanic-Logistic-Regression-Model)  
  
- Developed and evaluated a **Titanic Random Forest Classifier** to predict passenger survival using the preprocessed `train_scaled.csv` 
  - **GitHub**: [Titanic Random Forest Classifier](https://github.com/r-elopre/titanic_model_randomforest) 

- Developed and evaluated a **Titanic XGBoost Classifier** to predict passenger survival using the preprocessed `train_scaled.csv`. Features an untuned model (~82% accuracy) and a tuned model using GridSearchCV (0.8324 accuracy) with optimized hyperparameters (`learning_rate: 0.1`, `max_depth: 3`, `n_estimators: 100`).  
  - **GitHub**: [Titanic XGBoost Classifier](https://github.com/r-elopre/titanic_model_xgboost)  
- Developed and evaluated a **Titanic Feature Engineering and Model Stacking** to predict passenger survival using the preprocessed `train_scaled.csv`. Engineered features (`FamilySize`, `IsAlone`, `FarePerPerson`) and implemented a stacking ensemble of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving 0.8324 accuracy, outperforming individual models.
