## Professional Experience  

### Freelance Web Developer  
**Self-Employed / Personal Projects** â€” *April 2022 â€“ Present*  
- Developed a **full-stack social media web application** with real-time messaging, post creation (image/video uploads), user profiles (follow/unfollow), likes, comments, and a global feed, all mobile-responsive and performance-optimized.  
  - **Security Tests Passed**:  
    - âœ… **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Sanitized user-generated content using a reusable `escapeHTML()` function across all interactive views, preventing stored and reflected XSS.  
      ðŸ“¹ [Watch Test](https://youtu.be/jEscr0JXbuc?si=y0sEYaLsQSvYr-9K)  
    - âœ… **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Protected forms and JavaScript requests using Djangoâ€™s CSRF middleware with token injection for secure POST actions.  
      ðŸ“¹ [Watch Test](https://youtu.be/Jh_YLm9DIZs?si=b5Wsg9fTRG4e-ulo)  
    - âœ… **Authentication & Session Management**: Implemented password hashing with Djangoâ€™s `make_password()`, 20-minute session expiration, brute-force prevention via rate limiting, and secure cookies (Secure, HttpOnly).  
      ðŸ“¹ [Watch Test](https://youtu.be/GBs8rEWTVQ8?si=w12NQJJ4kikWT2CO)  
  - **Performance Tests Passed**:  
    - âœ… **Client-Side Media Optimization**: Reduced image file sizes by up to 80% using Compressor.js, enhancing upload speed and performance.  
    - âœ… **Caching Strategy**: Utilized Djangoâ€™s caching framework for posts, comments, and user data to reduce load times.  
      ðŸ“¹ [Watch Test](https://youtu.be/DV2VaTyp-XY?si=Yh0rFk50WXSFENsR)  
    - âœ… **Efficient Database Queries**: Eliminated N+1 issues with batch fetching, implemented offset-based pagination, and used selective field fetching to optimize performance.  
      ðŸ“¹ [Watch Test](https://youtu.be/-luhtWYskP8?si=HOieIin6wZVyuEQ4)  
    - âœ… **Non-Blocking JavaScript Architecture**: Employed modular, deferred scripts (`chat.js`, `post.js`), lazy execution, and efficient polling for minimal resource usage.

### Data Scientist  
**Self-Employed / Personal Projects** â€” *April 2022 â€“ Present*  
- Designed and implemented comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines for the **Titanic** and **Healthcare** datasets, transforming raw data into machine-learning-ready formats.  
  - **Titanic Data Cleaning Pipeline**:  
    - Built a 6-script Python pipeline (`diagnose.py`, `clean.py`, `EDA.py`, `process_data.py`, `encode_data.py`, `scale_data.py`) to clean, explore, and preprocess the Titanic dataset (891 rows, 12 columns).  
    - Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`), standardized categorical data, and scaled numeric features using `StandardScaler`.  
    - Generated EDA visualizations (histograms, bar plots, correlation heatmaps) to uncover survival patterns.  
    - **Output**: `train_scaled.csv` with encoded categorical variables and standardized numeric features, ready for modeling.  
    - **GitHub**: [Titanic Data Cleaning](https://github.com/r-elopre/titanic-data-cleaning)

    ### ðŸ”¹ Models Trained on Cleaned Data:
    1. [Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/r-elopre/Titanic-Logistic-Regression-Model) â€” baseline binary classification to predict survival.
      
  - **Healthcare Data Cleaning Pipeline**:  
    - Preprocessed a dataset (1000 rows, 10 columns) with 159â€“384 missing values per column.  
    - Handled missing values (`Age` with median, `Condition` with "Unknown", `Cholesterol` with mean), standardized date formats, and split `Blood Pressure` into Systolic/Diastolic.  
    - Performed EDA to identify age clusters (25, 35, 60, 70) and cholesterol distributions (160â€“220 mg/dL).  
    - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features (`Gender`, `Medication`) and scaled numeric features for ML compatibility.  
    - **Output**: `healthcare_scaled.csv`, fully numeric and scaled for modeling.  
    - **GitHub**: [Healthcare Data Cleaning](https://github.com/r-elopre/healthcare-data-cleaning)  

### Machine Learning Engineer  
**Self-Employed / Personal Projects** â€” *April 2022 â€“ Present*  
- Developed and evaluated a **Titanic Logistic Regression Model** to predict passenger survival using the preprocessed `train_scaled.csv` dataset (891 rows, 18 columns).  
  - Implemented a Python script (`titanic_model_logreg.py`) to load data, perform train-test split (80% train, 20% test), train a logistic regression model, and evaluate performance.  
  - Achieved ~82% accuracy, with precision (83% for Not Survived, 80% for Survived), recall (87% for Not Survived, 76% for Survived), and F1-scores (85% for Not Survived, 78% for Survived).  
  - Generated a confusion matrix heatmap (`confusion_matrix.png`) using Seaborn to visualize true/false positives and negatives.  
  - Saved test predictions with `PassengerId` to `titanic_logreg_predictions.csv` for further analysis.
